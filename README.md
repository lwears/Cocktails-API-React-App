## About

My project for the SALT HackDay. This was a challenge where we had to build a simple full stack app in one day.
Backend is NodeJS and Express with the help of Express Generator.
The express backend simply retrieves the data from the external Cocktail API and reorganises it.
The react frontend then fetches consumes the data.

The frontend is courtesy of 'create-react-app' built in React using hooks.
